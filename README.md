# CVE-2022-21449-TLS-PoC
CVE-2022-21449 ([also dubbed Psychic Signatures in the vulnerability writeup by Neil Madden](https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/)) Proof of Concept demonstrating its usage with a vulnerable client and a malicious TLS server.

The malicious server presents a valid (as of 2022-04-20) cert chain for www.google.com which has an ECDSA pub key (secp256r1). However, the `crypto/ecdsa` package has been modified to present an invalid signature with `r = s = 0`. The vulnerable client accepts this invalid signature, allowing the rest of the TLS handshake to continue.

Aside from the removed `*_test.go` files while building & exploration, all the golang library changes made to get this PoC working are annotated with a comment. Search/grep for `CVE-2022-21449` in the `go/src` directory to find them.

# Building
Requires some existing golang installation as well as maven, then run `./build.sh`.

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (WSL2) with OpenJDK 16.0.1 (build 16.0.1+9-Ubuntu-120.04, 2021-04-20)
